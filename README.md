## What's in This Repo?

We use this repo in two ways:

- [Issues](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues) to track several kinds of discussion on topics related with Research and IPFS, random ideas and proposals for new systems or features that don't fall on a specific repo yet. All the discussion happens in the issues.
- [OPEN_PROBLEMS](./OPEN_PROBLEMS) list and unpack the currently known Open Problems for IPFS.

**Disclaimer:** While we work hard to document our work as it progresses, research progress may not be fully reflected here for some time, or may be worked out out-of-band.

## Request for Proposals

Some of our Open Problems have open [RFPs](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps#rfps-and-grants). For all, we welcome any collaborations (potentially leading to new constructions, discoveries and publications). Please reach out at research@protocol.ai.

## Funding

[Protocol Labs runs an RFP (Request For Proposals)](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps) Program with the goal of funding individuals and groups to come up with novel solutions to the Open Problems found in this and other repos. If interested, please follow the link to check the active RFPs.
